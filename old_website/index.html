    	<h1>Hi there!</h1>
      <div id="content_index">
        <p>I am presently studying <span style="font-weight:bold">Computer Science</span> at <span style="font-weight:bold">Brown University</span> and expect to graduate <span style="font-weight:bold">May 2020</span>. I am currently on the Sc.B Professional Track but plan to pursue the 4-year Concurrent Masters Program in CS. I like to challenge myself by taking on a rigorous load of coursework each semester in addition to the various activities and extracurriculars that I participate in.</p>

        <p>I am passionate and experienced in <span style="font-weight:bold">data science/visualization</span>, <span style="font-weight:bold">artificial intelligence</span>, and <span style="font-weight:bold">software/web development</span>. As of late, I have also been increasingly interested in VR/AR technologies as well as HCI research. My interests outside of CS are also fairly diverse, and reach into many disciplines including economics, English, cognitive neuroscience, biotechnology, and visual arts.</p>

        <p> In my free time, I like to fold origami, practice violin, play tennis/exercise with friends, or play Go. I also enjoy playing/developing video games and conducting research in Brown's robotics lab. For more information regarding my coursework and activities, please take a look at my <a href="/resume.html">resume</a> and <a href="/projects.html">projects</a> pages.</p> <br>
